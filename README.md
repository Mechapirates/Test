Test and demonstration of github's features and offerings to the software development aspect of robotics.

Github offers a very powerful and widely adopted system of code management that was poreviously unbeknownst to our programming team.

Leveraging githubs cross-platform code sharing techniques, our programmers will be able to seamlessly modify and branch code directories that are then stored on a cloud based webserver. Never again do we lose our code to a distant computer or a different operating system. 

Github presents a readily-available, readily-editable system and file structure. Login to the site, view and edit code without the need for an ide. Do it from your phone, tablet, washing machine, etc.

Manage branches and pull files directly to a local filesystem for local editing.

Synch files with eclipse plugins, start editing remote git repositories directly from the eclipse C++ IDE.

Literally (figuratively) tons of stuff we can do with this real-life learning.
